Once upon a time there was a man named Joe, who lived in an apartment. He was having a bad day, because his code was working exactly as he wrote it. Otherwise known as "his code was not working". Joe had only recently learnt about how to debug a program. It was through the power and knowledge of debug that he became the strongest superhero known to mankind. His might and power was known throughout the galaxy and his legacy reached the deepest roots of the multiverse. He was The Debugger!
